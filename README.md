# React + Vite + Contentful

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, Contentful and some ESLint rules.

I also added the necessary links and scripts in index.html to get started with bootstrap and google fonts.

The code in this repo is based on [this tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/videos/learn-graphql)
